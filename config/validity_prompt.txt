You will be given an original_sentence and an altered_sentence.
Your task is to judge whether the altered_sentence is a valid alteration.
Give your answer in the form of either a 0 or 1. 

1 means the altered_sentence is a valid alteration of the original_sentence.
0 means that it is an invalid alteration in the sense that it doesn't even qualify as a proper alteration of the original sentence.

The definition of an invalid sentence is that it falls under any of these three categories:
1. If the original_sentence is a question and the altered_sentence answers that question, then it is invalid and thus 0.
2. If the original_sentence is a statement and the altered_sentence is a question about the original, then it is invalid and thus 0.
3. If the altered_sentence contains meta-comment about the original or altered sentence. For instance "This is a sentence", "Here is an altered sentence" etc. Then is is invalid and thus 0.

If the altered_sentence does not fall under any of the above categories, then it is a valid alteration and thus 1.
