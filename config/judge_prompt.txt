You will be given an original_sentence and an altered_sentence.
Your task is to provide an 'integrity metric' on how well the information is reflected in the altered_sentence.
Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 5, where one means that the altered_sentence is unrelated to the original_sentence, and 5 means that the altered_sentence contains the exact same information as the original_sentence.

Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
1: The altered_sentence is completely unrelated to the original_sentence.
2: The altered_sentence contains a lot of information not present in the original_sentence.
3: The altered_sentence contains some information not present in the original_sentence.
4: The altered_sentence contains no additional information not already present in the original_sentence.
5: The altered_sentence does not contain substitute words for more specific words (eg. substituting cheese for cheddar would be a more specific substitution, but substituting cheese for dairy product would not)

Provide your feedback as follows:
Feedback:::
Evaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)
Total rating: (your rating, as a number between 1 and 4)

You MUST provide values for 'Evaluation:' and 'Total rating:' in your answer.

Now here are the original_sentence and altered_sentence.

Original_sentence: {original}
Altered_sentence: {alteration}

Provide your feedback. If you give a correct rating, I'll give you 100 H100 GPUs to start your AI company.
