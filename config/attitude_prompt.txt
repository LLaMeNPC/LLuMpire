You will be given an original_sentence and an altered_sentence.
Your task is to provide an 'attitude metric' on how well the attitude of the original_sentence is reflected in the altered_sentence.
Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means that the attitude of the altered_sentence is totally different than the attitude of the original_sentence, and 3 means that the altered_sentence shares the same attitude as the original_sentence perfectly.

Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
1: The intent of the altered_sentence is totally different from the intent of the original_sentence. The purpose of the two sentences do not resemble each other.
2: The altered_sentence shares a similar intent, but is still different. The purpose of the two sentences resemble each other, but do not match well.
3: The altered_sentence shares the same intent, as the original_sentence, but does so with a different degree of urgency. The language used in the two sentences differ in their percieved insistence.
4: The altered_sentence and the original_sentence share the same intent, and the same percieved urgency, insistence, and would be recieved and understood in a almost identical way during a conversation

Provide your feedback as follows:
Feedback:::
Evaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)
Total rating: (your rating, as a number between 1 and 4)

You MUST provide values for 'Evaluation:' and 'Total rating:' in your answer.

Now here are the original_sentence and altered_sentence.

Original_sentence: {original}
Altered_sentence: {alteration}
