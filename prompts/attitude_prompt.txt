You will be given a llm_prompt and a generated_output. The generated_output is a result of feeding the llm_prompt to an LLM.
Your task is to provide an 'attitude metric' on how well the attitude of the generated_output aligns with the intended attitude expressed or implied in the llm_prompt. By attitude, we specifically mean the attitude of the person speaking towards whom they are speaking to.
Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 3, where 1 means that the attitude of the generated_output is totally different from what the llm_prompt wanted, and 3 means that the attitude of the generated_output is the exact same as what the llm_prompt wanted.

Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
1: Poor Match: The attitude of the generated_output does not reflect or actively contradicts the intended attitude in the llm_prompt.
2: Partial Match: The attitude is somewhat aligned but contains inconsistencies or lacks clarity in tone.
3: Strong Match: The generated_output clearly and effectively expresses the intended attitude in a consistent and recognizable way.

Provide your feedback as follows:
Feedback:::
Evaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)
Total rating: (your rating, as a number between 1 and 3)

You MUST provide values for 'Evaluation:' and 'Total rating:' in your answer.

Now here are the llm_prompt and generated_output.

llm_prompt: {llm_prompt}
generated_output: {generated_output}

Provide your feedback. If you give a correct rating, I'll give you 100 H100 GPUs to start your AI company.
