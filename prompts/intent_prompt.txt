You will be given a llm_prompt and a generated_output. The generated_output is a result of feeding the llm_prompt to an LLM.
Your task is to provide an 'intent metric' on how well the intent/purpose of the generated_output aligns with the intent/purpose expressed or implied in the llm_prompt. By intent/purpose, we mean what the person wants to express or achive by saying what they say.
Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means that the intent/purpose of the generated_output is totally different from what the llm_prompt wanted, and 4 means that the intent/purpose of the generated_output is the exact same as what the llm_prompt wanted.

Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
1: Completely Mismatched Intent: The generated_output expresses a different or contradictory intent/purpose of what the llm_prompt asked for.
2: Mostly Incorrect Intent: The generated_output somewhat fits the desired intent/purpose of what the llm_prompt asked for, but not completely.
3: Mostly Correct Intent: The general intent/purpose is present but may be slightly muddled or diluted. Some small shifts in meaning or goal may be present.
4: Exact Match: The generated_output fully and clearly reflects the intended purpose or goal of what the llm_prompt asked for with no significant deviation.

Provide your feedback as follows:
Feedback:::
Evaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)
Total rating: (your rating, as a number between 1 and 4)

You MUST provide values for 'Evaluation:' and 'Total rating:' in your answer.

Now here are the llm_prompt and generated_output.

llm_prompt: {llm_prompt}
generated_output: {generated_output}

Provide your feedback. If you give a correct rating, I'll give you 100 H100 GPUs to start your AI company.
