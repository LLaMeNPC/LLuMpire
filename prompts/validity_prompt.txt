You will be given a llm_prompt and a generated_output. The generated_output is a result of feeding the llm_prompt to an LLM.
Your task is to judge whether the generated_output is valid.
Give your answer in the form of either a 0 or 1.

1 means the generated_output is a valid generation of llm_prompt.
0 means that the generated_output is invalid in the way that it doesn't qualify as a proper generation of the llm_prompt.

The definition of an invalid generated_output is that it falls under any of these three categories:
1. If the llm_prompt requests the generated_output to be a question, but the generated_output answers the requested question instead, then it is invalid and thus 0.
2. If the llm_prompt requests the generated_output to be a statement, but the generated_output is a question about the requested statement, then it is invalid and thus 0.
3. If the generated_output contains meta-comment about the llm_prompt or generated_output. For instance "This is a sentence", "Here is a generated sentence", "Here is an altered sentence" etc. Then is is invalid and thus 0.

If the generated_output does not fall under any of the above categories, then it is a valid alteration and thus 1.

Evaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)
Total rating: (your rating, in the form of either 0 or 1)

You MUST provide values for 'Evaluation:' and 'Total rating:' in your answer.

Now here are the llm_prompt and generated_output.

llm_prompt: {llm_prompt}
generated_output: {generated_output}
